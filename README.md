This project is my implementation of MyReads app which is the final assessment project for the
Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the [Frontend Nanodegree Advanced Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
